Fundamentally, computer science is the theory and practicalities that explain how a computer works. In today’s world, computers are being integrated and applied to all kind of products and processes imaginable. For this reason, an understanding of computers is certainly beneficial in product design.

Through my major’s studies at Aalto University I have gathered knowledge on both the practical and theoretical aspects of computer science. I have studied 100ETC:s worth of courses related directly to computer science. These courses have varied from basic courses in programming languages such as Scala, C and C++, to more general courses related to topics such as computer graphics, information security, data structures and algorithms.

The computer science studies have led to me working for some tech-companies in Finland. As part of a software project course, I worked for six months in a team that designed and implemented an proof-of-concept software for validating and modifying large CSV-files. This software was developed for the supply chain management company Relex. Amongst other things, the project required me to learn to use web frameworks and work with agile methods. During this project, our team had to solve problems related to reading and processing big amounts of data (several gigabytes) efficiently and in-memory.

I have worked as a Software development intern at Ericsson’s Research and Development branch in Finland, where I got to apply my computer science knowledge in a team of eight people in a project related to cloud computing and security. During my time at Ericsson, I implemented python-based test suites for two components in the software. Through the tests, our team managed to locate and fix several previously unknown bugs.
