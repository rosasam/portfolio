I am a curious person. I want to know how stuff works, and once I learn that, I start thinking how it could be improved. 

I actively try to discover new ideas and try them out. Even if a trial fails, it is better than not trying at all. I have participated twice in the hackathon Junction, which consisted of over 5000 participants last year. Last year, my team created a “social alarm clock” app that would wake you and your friends up at the same time. We couldn’t finish the project during the hackathon since we lacked the technical expertise on how to do real-time streaming between several mobile devices, but the concept of the project was still well received during the event. 

My career choices also reflect my innovative attitude: I have enjoyed jobs in which I can make meaningful changes for the company. During my time as a graphic design intern at MAO Design, I redesigned the look of their school calendars. The new design was picked up by a new client. Currently, I work at a three-person tech startup, where my ideas have led to a faster workflow when using our company’s internal software.
