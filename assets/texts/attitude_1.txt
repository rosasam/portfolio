I’m not one to give up easily. If I set my mind on something, I will try my best to achieve whatever goal I have set for myself. This does not mean that I wouldn’t have had setbacks and times when I’ve given up; the important thing is that I have always picked myself up and continued onwards.

One way this can be seen in my life is through my running. Three years ago I ran my first 10k race, two years ago I ran my first half marathon. This year, I’m training to run my first marathon. Last year, I couldn’t run the race I had planned because of getting ill, but this has not stopped me from training and looking for new opportunities.

I have also shown persistence in my studies. When I started studying computer science, I had practically zero programming skills, and was frustrated with how slowly I wrote code compared to my more experienced peers. Now I am at the verge of completing my Bachelor’s program in Computer Science, and work part-time as a capable software developer.
