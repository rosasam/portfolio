To quote graphic designer Paul Rand: “Everything is design. Everything”. Good design is an essential part of any good product. Design is just more than the look of and feel, it’s the interface with which we interact with an product. Knowing the user, and adapting to the user’s needs, material choices, concepts, sketches, prototypes; all this is part of design. I try to incorporate these thoughts into my projects, from conception to final product. 

Graphic design is a great passion for me. I have worked as an art design assistant during summers for four years, which started my path to thinking in terms of design. I’m also active in the guild Teknologföreningen as a “freelance” graphic designer, and continue to hone my design thinking skills by creating posters, ad-campaigns and magazines for the guild’s purposes. During the two years I’ve been doing work for Teknologföreningen I’ve layouted eight magazines and completed over 40 other design projects, such as marketing banners, badges and posters. 

Furthermore, in the three courses I have taken in my minor, Aaltonaut, all have featured a product design project as part of the course. These projects have given me a great opportunity to employ my creativity and design thinking to actual product development problems.
