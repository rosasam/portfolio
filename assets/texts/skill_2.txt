Working in groups is inevitable in most lines of work. I can usually get a good grasp of what a project entails, and like to take matters into my own hands and make sure that the group succeeds. In my time at Aalto, I have learned the value of good communication, transparency and compromises. Through my minor Aaltonaut and other courses at Aalto, I have participated in six course-spanning group projects. In these courses, in which the grade was entirely based on the success of the group project and peer evaluation, my average is 4.8/5. Furthermore, Iâ€™ve taken ten other courses where a major part of the course was a group project. 

Outside of school, I am a scout leader, who is responsible for leading a group of kids on a weekly basis. I have been a scout leader for 5 years, leading groups of five to ten people. I have also been in charge of organizing events for the scout troop, such as camping trips and scout skill competitions. Organizing these events has both been an exercise in both leadership and teamwork.
