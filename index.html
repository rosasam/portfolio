                Fundamentally, computer science is the theory and practicalities
                that explain how a computer works. In today’s world, computers
                are being integrated and applied to all kind of products and
                processes imaginable. For this reason, an understanding of
                computers is certainly beneficial in product design.
                <br /><br />
                Through my major’s studies at Aalto University I have gathered
                knowledge on both the practical and theoretical aspects of
                computer science. I have studied 100ETC:s worth of courses
                related directly to computer science. These courses have varied
                from basic courses in programming languages such as Scala, C and
                C++, to more general courses related to topics such as computer
                graphics, information security, data structures and algorithms.
                <br /><br />
                The computer science studies have led to me working for some
                tech-companies in Finland. As part of a software project course,
                I worked for six months in a team that designed and implemented
                an proof-of-concept software for validating and modifying large
                CSV-files. This software was developed for the supply chain
                management company Relex. Amongst other things, the project
                required me to learn to use web frameworks and work with agile
                methods. During this project, our team had to solve problems
                related to reading and processing big amounts of data (several
                gigabytes) efficiently and in-memory.
                <br /><br />
                I have worked as a Software development intern at Ericsson’s
                Research and Development branch in Finland, where I got to apply
                my computer science knowledge in a team of eight people in a
                project related to cloud computing and security. During my time
                at Ericsson, I implemented python-based test suites for two
                components in the software. Through the tests, our team managed
                to locate and fix several previously unknown bugs.

                Usually people attribute creativity and an “artistic eye” to
                good designers. But there’s something to be said about designers
                who are capable of efficiently putting their thoughts into a
                tangible form. I have always had a quite technical approach to
                design, and I am very comfortable with efficiently operating all
                kinds of different design software software. I am especially
                familiar with Adobe’s programs, such as Photoshop, InDesign,
                Illustrator and Premiere, which are used for image editing,
                layout, vector graphics and movie editing respectively.
                <br /><br />
                Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator were my essential toolkit in
                my four years as a graphic designer. Just from my time working
                at a graphic design company, I have put over 1500 hours combined
                into working with these programs. Furthermore, I have done
                several projects related to photography, movies and graphic
                design in my free time, further adding to these hours. Some
                examples are the two short movies that I made in high school
                using Premiere, the magazines (already mentioned in Design
                Thinking) I did using InDesign, and the over 40 design projects
                I did using a combination of Photoshop, InDesign and
                Illustrator.
