Usually people attribute creativity and an “artistic eye” to good designers. But there’s something to be said about designers who are capable of efficiently putting their thoughts into a tangible form. I have always had a quite technical approach to design, and I am very comfortable with efficiently operating all kinds of different design software software. I am especially familiar with Adobe’s programs, such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator and Premiere, which are used for image editing, layout, vector graphics and movie editing respectively. 

Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator were my essential toolkit in my four years as a graphic designer. Just from my time working at a graphic design company, I have put over 1500 hours combined into working with these programs. Furthermore, I have done several projects related to photography, movies and graphic design in my free time, further adding to these hours. Some examples are the two short movies that I made in high school using Premiere, the magazines (already mentioned in Design Thinking) I did using InDesign, and the over 40 design projects I did using a combination of Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator. 

These programs have also proven useful in product development. Often the product development process requires visualization of ideas in some form or other, and being able to quickly sketch up ideas and even make more refined illustrations has been beneficial.
